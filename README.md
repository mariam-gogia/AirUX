# Milestones

## Week 1: Setting up a development environment 

Setting up a laptop, developing the environment, setting up sensory hardware, and software. 

## Week 2: Find & Learn
Allocate and review all necessary resources (SensorTile tutorials, Python, and ML libraries) and materials needed for the successful completion of the project. Deepen understanding of lecture materials & SensorTile. 
 
## Week 3: Input Pipeline Establishment
Read SensorTile input data, understand how to handle streams of raw bytes, and interpret them into a structure that returns SensorTile measurements. 

## Week 4: Dataset Preparation
Extract useful data from the sensor (data filtering). Work on motion recognition and data labeling (e.g. swipe-left, swipe-right, click, etc.).

## Week 5: Training & Visualization
SensorTile-cursor movement synchronization. Model development (supervised classification learning).

## Week 6: Model Optimization & Program Enhancement
Issuing action commands (e.g swipe left, click). Increase response accuracy. 

## Week 7: QA & Presentation 
Recording demos and preparing a presentation.
