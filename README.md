# AirUX

## Name
AirUx or AirGesture. 

## Team
![Team](https://github.com/mariam-gogia/AirUX/blob/master/src/images/Team.png)

## Goal
Replicate a traditional device (mouse) using SensorTile.  Create a new user experience for Human-Computer Interaction, utilizing motion sensory and gesture commands. 

## Tech kit
Python and PyAutoGUI for Mouse Control library, 
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras for signal analysis, signal processing, and machine learning model development. 

IDEs:
Hardware - Workbench 
Software - Anaconda, Sublime, VisualStudio, Pycharm.

# Milestones

![Milestones](https://github.com/mariam-gogia/AirUX/blob/master/src/images/Milestones.png)

## Week 1: Setting up a development environment 

Setting up development environment, sensory hardware and software. 

## Week 2: Find & Learn
Allocate and review all necessary resources (SensorTile tutorials, Python, and ML libraries) and materials needed for the successful completion of the project. Deepen understanding of lecture materials, especially SensorTile capabilities and constraints. 
 
## Week 3: Input Pipeline Establishment
Read SensorTile input data, understand how to handle streams of raw bytes, and interpret them into a structure that returns SensorTile measurements. 

## Week 4: Dataset Preparation
Extract useful data from the sensor (data filtering). Expand data representation (Cartesion, Spherical Coordinates, Deltas, etc). 
Work on motion recognition and data labeling (e.g. swipe-left, swipe-right, click, etc.).

## Week 5: Training & Visualization
SensorTile-cursor movement synchronization (acceleration, rotation, displacement, etc.)  
Model development (Random Forest, supervised classification learning).

## Week 6: Model Optimization & Program Enhancement
Issuing action commands (e.g swipe left, click). Increase response accuracy. 
Import model movement-predication accuracy. 

## Week 7: QA & Presentation 
Recording demos and preparing a presentation.
